# Clothing Classifier

This project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the type of clothing from images. The model is trained using the Fashion MNIST dataset from Zalando, which contains images of various clothing types.

## Contents

- **Convolutional Neural Network Model**: Implemented with TensorFlow and Keras.
- **Data Augmentation**: Data augmentation techniques are used to improve the model's generalization.
- **Image Prediction**: Ability to predict clothing types from user-provided images.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- TensorFlow Datasets
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV
- Pillow (PIL)

You can install the necessary dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow tensorflow-datasets matplotlib opencv-python pillow
```

## Usage

1. **Download the Dataset**: The code automatically downloads the Fashion MNIST dataset upon starting.

2. **Train the Model**: The model is trained for a specified number of epochs using training and validation data.

3. **Prediction**:
   - The model can predict clothing types from images in the validation set.
   - You can also load your own clothing image, and the model will provide a prediction.

### Example Usage

To predict a clothing image, simply place your image in the same folder as the script and ensure the filename is correctly specified in the following code snippet:

```python
# Load and convert the image to grayscale
image_path = "your_image_name.jpg"  # Change this to your file
```

## Clothing Classes

The model can classify images into the following categories:

- T-shirt/top
- Trouser
- Pullover
- Dress
- Coat
- Sandal
- Shirt
- Sneaker
- Bag
- Ankle boot

## Results

The model's performance is evaluated on a validation dataset, and loss graphs can be observed during training.
